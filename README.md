WinX Presentation Foundation - Enhancements to WPF for Windows 10

The concept is "simplicity".  WPF hasn't been "caught up" much since the advent of Windows 10.  
What this library does is offer some overrides of DEFAULT WPF controls and settings to support or mimick what is now available in UWP or the WinUI bridge.  In a nutshell, I wanted a simple way to write WPF applications that use the basic GUI features available in WPF and Visual Studio but get that Windows 10 look and feel.  

*Sources coming soon - still testing*  
 
**Basic Feature List**

Support for Windows 10 DarkMode in WPF
- Including theme overrides for Base WPF controls.
- Theme colors are AUTOMATICALLY applied from OS settings.
- Capability to wire up detection of OS Theme mode switch and respond without App Restart.


    
Addition of Missing Base Controls
- NumericUpDown.
