WinX Presentation Foundation - Enhancements to WPF for Windows 10

The concept is "simplicity".  WPF hasn't been "caught up" much since the advent of Windows 10.  
<br>
What this library does is offer some overrides of DEFAULT WPF controls and settings to support or mimick what is now available in UWP or the WinUI bridge.  In a nutshell, I wanted a simple way to write WPF applications that use the basic GUI features available in WPF and Visual Studio but get that Windows 10 look and feel.  

***NOTE***  
This code is STILL VERY YOUNG - and is still being updated and changed often.  It is in NO WAY production ready. There are still several major changes/enhancements in the roadmap before it's even in "beta-test" status - so be advised.  
<br>
**Additionally:** I will add a sample implementation in another app I am working on in the next round of updates - as well as some basic documentation on how it all works.  For now this repo is MOSTLY a placeholder while the project moves forward to testing.

<br>
