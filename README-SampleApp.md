# About the WXPF Sample App

***NOTE***<br>
This code is STILL VERY YOUNG - and is still being updated and changed often.  It is in NO WAY production ready. There are still several major changes/enhancements in the roadmap before it's even in "beta-test" status - so be advised.  
<br>
<br>
The SampleApp is a "BASE" implementation I worked out to get a WPF app to respond to the Windows10 OS Dark/Light Theme settings.
<br>
<br>
There will be changes to the WXPF class to support proper hooking of WXWindows for some of the trickery required to make the context menus and scroll bars proper themed - this will fix support for multiple windows. Also needed is completion of the WXApplication class which will encapsulate the wireup for themeing to be easier.
<br>
<br>
**THIS IS ALL EXPERIMENTAL STILL**<br>
(but the DarkMode is a cool trick, so I'm still working on it...)
